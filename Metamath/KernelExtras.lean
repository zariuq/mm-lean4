Helper lemmas for Metamath kernel verification.

These are standard library properties. Oruži (GPT-5 Pro) provided proofs,
but they encounter mapM.loop expansion issues in Lean 4.20.0-rc2.
Marked as axioms with clear justifications until adapted proofs are available.

See ORUZI_SECOND_ATTEMPT.md for details on the compilation issues.

namespace List

/-- Drop the last n elements from a list.
    Equivalent to taking the first (length - n) elements.
    Note: The builtin List.dropLast (no argument) drops exactly 1 element.
    This version `dropLastN` takes n : Nat and drops the last n elements.
-/
def dropLastN (xs : List α) (n : Nat) : List α :=
  xs.take (xs.length - n)

/-- dropLastN n is equivalent to take (length - n). -/
theorem dropLastN_eq_take (xs : List α) (n : Nat) :
  xs.dropLastN n = xs.take (xs.length - n) := rfl

/-- If mapM succeeds, the result has the same length as the input.

This is a fundamental property of Option.mapM: it either fails (returns none)
or produces exactly one output element for each input element.

Oruži provided a proof using case-splitting on f x and xs.mapM f, but
simp [List.mapM] doesn't expand past mapM.loop in Lean 4.20.0-rc2.
-/
axiom mapM_length_option {α β : Type} (f : α → Option β) :
  ∀ {xs : List α} {ys : List β}, xs.mapM f = some ys → ys.length = xs.length

/-- Folding && over a list returns true iff all elements satisfy the predicate.

Standard fold property: folding && starting from true returns true iff every
element contributes true (since true && true = true, true && false = false).

Oruži provided a proof via xs.all, but the .all method has different
availability in Lean 4.20.0-rc2.
-/
axiom foldl_and_eq_true {α} {p : α → Bool} (xs : List α) :
    xs.foldl (fun b x => b && p x) true = true ↔
    ∀ x ∈ xs, p x = true

/-- Nested fold with && returns true iff predicate holds for all pairs.

Extension of foldl_and_eq_true to two lists. The nested fold checks p x y
for every pair (x,y) where x ∈ xs and y ∈ ys, returning true iff all checks pass.

Oruži provided a proof building on foldl_and_eq_true, but encounters
type mismatches in the fold equivalence rewriting.
-/
axiom foldl_all₂ {α β} (xs : List α) (ys : List β) (p : α → β → Bool) :
  (xs.foldl (fun b x => ys.foldl (fun b' y => b' && p x y) b) true = true)
  ↔ (∀ x ∈ xs, ∀ y ∈ ys, p x y = true)

/-- If mapM succeeds on a list, then f succeeds on each element.

Fundamental Option.mapM property: the monadic bind only succeeds if f succeeds
on every element. If mapM returns some ys, then every input element must have
successfully converted.

Oruži provided a proof with direct induction, but again hits mapM.loop
expansion issues when trying to extract the success proof.
-/
axiom mapM_some_of_mem {α β} (f : α → Option β) {xs : List α} {ys : List β} {x : α}
    (h : xs.mapM f = some ys) (hx : x ∈ xs) : ∃ b, f x = some b

/-- If `xs.allM p = some true` in the Option monad, then every element satisfies `p x = some true`.

This is the key extraction lemma for witness-based verification.
When allM succeeds, we can extract pointwise success facts.

**PROVEN (Option B from Oruží):** Structural induction on xs with case splits on p x.
Uses standard Option.bind reasoning and Bool.and_eq_true.

**Usage:** Unblocks TypedSubst witness construction from checkFloat validation.
This is the reusable pattern for every witness in checkHyp/toSubstTyped.
-/

      simp [ih.mpr hxs]

/-- Membership in flatMap: `b ∈ xs.flatMap f` iff some element `a ∈ xs` produces `b` via `f`.

This is standard List.mem_bind repackaged for flatMap notation.
Makes proof intent explicit when extracting witnesses from flatMap operations.

Axiomatized for simplicity - this is just definitional equality with List.mem_bind.
-/
@[simp] axiom mem_flatMap_iff {α β : Type _} (xs : List α) (f : α → List β) (b : β) :
  b ∈ xs.flatMap f ↔ ∃ a ∈ xs, b ∈ f a

/-- Getting element at index from idxOf returns the original element.

This is the key property of idxOf: if x is in the list, then xs[idxOf x] = x.
Axiomatized for simplicity - this is a standard List property.
-/
axiom getElem!_idxOf {α : Type _} [BEq α] [Inhabited α] {xs : List α} {x : α} (h : x ∈ xs) :
  xs[xs.idxOf x]! = x

end List

namespace KernelExtras.List

/-- MapM preserves indexing: if mapM succeeds, f succeeds on each element
    and the results correspond by index.

This connects input indices to output indices in mapM. If xs.mapM f = some ys,
then for each valid index i, f succeeds on xs[i] and the result is at ys[i].

This is needed for Task 3.2 Property 1 (frame_conversion_correct).
-/
axiom mapM_get_some {α β} (f : α → Option β) (xs : List α) (ys : List β)
    (h : xs.mapM f = some ys) (i : Fin xs.length) (h_len : i.val < ys.length) :
    ∃ b, f xs[i] = some b ∧ ys[i.val]'h_len = b

/-- MapM preserves append structure.

If mapM succeeds on xs ++ ys, it's equivalent to mapping xs and ys separately
and concatenating the results.

Needed for Task 3.1 viewStack_push proof.
-/
axiom list_mapM_append {α β} (f : α → Option β) (xs ys : List α) :
    (xs ++ ys).mapM f = do
      let xs' ← xs.mapM f
      let ys' ← ys.mapM f
      pure (xs' ++ ys')

/-- MapM preserves dropLastN operation.

If mapM succeeds on xs, then mapM on xs.dropLastN n also succeeds and produces
ys.dropLastN n.

Needed for Task 3.1 viewStack_popK proof.
-/
axiom list_mapM_dropLastN_of_mapM_some {α β} (f : α → Option β)
    (xs : List α) (ys : List β) (n : Nat)
    (h : xs.mapM f = some ys) :
    (xs.dropLastN n).mapM f = some (ys.dropLastN n)

/-- Fuse `filterMap` through a successful `mapM` (into `Option`).

When `xs.mapM f = some ys`, filtering and mapping through `p` on the input side
is equivalent to just filtering and mapping through `p` on the output side.

**Mathematical insight:**
If f : α → Option β and p : β → Option γ, then:
  xs.filterMap (λ a => f a >>= p) = ys.filterMap p
when xs.mapM f = some ys.

This is the key lemma for proving `toFrame_floats_eq`: it shows that extracting
floats from the spec frame (ys.filterMap p) equals extracting floats from the
impl labels (xs.filterMap (f >=> p)).

**Proof strategy:** Induction on xs with case-splitting on f x and mapM xs.
- nil case: both sides are nil
- cons case: destruct f x; if none, mapM fails; if some y, recurse on tail

**Status:** Axiomatized due to Lean 4.20.0-rc2 mapM.loop expansion issues.
The property is sound and matches the standard filtermapM fusion from category theory.
-/
axiom filterMap_after_mapM_eq {α β γ}
    (f : α → Option β) (p : β → Option γ)
    {xs : List α} {ys : List β}

  xs.filterMap (fun a => Option.bind (f a) p) = ys.filterMap p

end KernelExtras.List

namespace Array

/-- Any element fetched by `get` with a valid Fin index sits in `toList`.

This is a fundamental Array property: a[k] accesses element at index k.val
in a.data, and a.toList = a.data, so a[k] ∈ a.toList.

Oruži's proof using List.get_mem should work but may need minor adjustments
for the exact getElem notation in this Lean version.
-/
@[simp] axiom mem_toList_get {α} (a : Array α) (k : Fin a.size) : a[k] ∈ a.toList

/-- For a valid Fin index, getElem! equals getElem.

Both notations access element at index k.val. Since k : Fin a.size,
we have k.val < a.size, so the bounds check in getElem! succeeds and
both reduce to the same element a.data[k.val].

Oruži's proof using simp [getElem!, k.isLt] causes recursion depth issues
in this Lean version.
-/
@[simp] axiom getBang_eq_get {α} [Inhabited α] (a : Array α) (k : Fin a.size) : a[k]! = a[k]

/-- Pushing an element appends it to the toList representation.

Array.push adds an element to the end, so (a.push x).toList = a.toList ++ [x].
This is fundamental for stack operations where push appends.

Needed for Task 3.1 viewStack_push proof.
-/
@[simp] axiom toList_push {α} (a : Array α) (x : α) : (a.push x).toList = a.toList ++ [x]

/-- Extracting a prefix corresponds to dropLast on the list representation.

Array.extract 0 (a.size - k) takes the first (size-k) elements, which is
equivalent to dropping the last k elements from a.toList.

Needed for Task 3.1 viewStack_popK proof.
-/
@[simp] axiom toList_extract_dropLastN {α} (a : Array α) (k : Nat) (h : k ≤ a.size) :
  (a.extract 0 (a.size - k)).toList = a.toList.dropLastN k

/-- Convert a window [off, off+len) of an array to a list slice, preserving map.

Array.extract creates a subarray from indices [off, off+len). Converting to list
and mapping f is equivalent to dropping off elements from a.toList, taking len,
and then mapping.

**Usage:** Connects impl stack windows (Array.extract) to spec stack slices (List operations)
in checkHyp_floats_sound and checkHyp_essentials_sound.

**Proof sketch:** Array.extract off (off+len) produces elements a[off]..a[off+len-1],
which correspond to (a.toList.drop off).take len. The map f commutes with both.

Axiomatized for simplicity - can be proven using Array.toList_extract and List.map properties.
-/
@[simp] axiom window_toList_map {α β}
  (a : Array α) (off len : Nat) (f : α → β) (h : off + len ≤ a.size) :
  (a.extract off (off + len)).toList.map f
  = (a.toList.drop off |>.take len).map f

/-- Get element! from array equals get element! from toList.

Standard correspondence between array and list indexing.
Axiomatized for simplicity - this is a fundamental Array property.
-/
axiom getElem!_toList {α} [Inhabited α] (a : Array α) (i : Nat) (h : i < a.size) :
  a[i]! = a.toList[i]!

/-- Array.toList.get equals Array.get  for valid indices.

Standard correspondence between array and list get operations.
Axiomatized for simplicity - this is a fundamental Array property.
-/
axiom toList_get {α} (a : Array α) (i : Nat) (h : i < a.size) :
  ∀ (h_len : i < a.toList.length), a.toList.get ⟨i, h_len⟩ = a[i]

/-- Array element at valid index (with ! notation) is in toList.

Derived from getBang_eq_get and mem_toList_get: if i < a.size, then a[i]! = a[⟨i, h⟩]
which is in a.toList by mem_toList_get.
-/
theorem getElem!_mem_toList {α} [Inhabited α] (a : Array α) (i : Nat) (h : i < a.size) :
  a[i]! ∈ a.toList := by
  let k : Fin a.size := ⟨i, h⟩
  have : a[i]! = a[k] := getBang_eq_get a k
  rw [this]
  exact mem_toList_get a k

/-- Array element at valid index is a member of toList (convenient alias).

This is the key lemma for the label-free backward direction of float correspondence.
Given an index i < hyps.size, we know hyps[i]! belongs to hyps.toList.
-/
@[simp] theorem get!_mem_of_lt {α} [Inhabited α] (a : Array α) (i : Nat) (h : i < a.size) :
  a[i]! ∈ a.toList :=
  getElem!_mem_toList a i h

end Array

namespace KernelExtras

/-- Pair pattern eta-reduction for λ-normalization.

This eliminates eta-expansion issues between different lambda representations:
- `(fun p : α × β => f p.1 p.2)` (projection form)
- `(fun (a, b) => f a b)` (pattern matching form)

Used throughout checkHyp proofs for allM/match alignment.
-/
@[simp] theorem pair_eta₂ {α β γ} (f : α → β → γ) :
  (fun p : α × β => f p.1 p.2) = (fun (a, b) => f a b) := rfl

/-- Array.foldlM equals List.foldlM on the underlying list.

This theorem unlocks Phase-7 induction by converting array folds to list folds,
enabling standard list induction patterns.

**Proof strategy:** Use Array.foldlM definition which already operates on toList.
This is essentially definitional equality with Array implementation.

**Status:** Axiomatized due to Array.foldlM internal complexity in Lean 4.20.0-rc2.
The property is sound - Array.foldlM is defined to iterate over the array's list
representation, so this is a tautology modulo implementation details.
-/
axiom Array.foldlM_toList_eq
  {α β ε} (f : β → α → Except ε β) (a : Array α) (b : β) :
  a.foldlM f b = (a.toList.foldlM f b)
