Array and List infrastructure lemmas for Metamath verification.

This module centralizes array/list bridge theorems and infrastructure axioms.
These are standard library properties that should eventually be proven or
migrated to Batteries.

After Lean 4.24.0 + Batteries v4.24.0 upgrade (November 2025):
- Several axioms were eliminated using Batteries-provided lemmas
- Remaining axioms have documented proof strategies in AXIOMS.md

These are fundamental Option.mapM properties. Proofs encounter mapM.loop
expansion issues - the monadic bind structure doesn't simplify cleanly.

See AXIOMS.md for documented proof strategies.

/-- If mapM succeeds, the result has the same length as the input.

This is a fundamental property of Option.mapM: it either fails (returns none)
or produces exactly one output element for each input element.

/-- If mapM succeeds, then indexing the result corresponds to mapping the input.

COMPLETED: The "unknown tactic" error was caused by Lean 4.24.0 parser bug
with deeply nested case splits. Fixed by:
1. Extracting final case analysis into `mapM_get_some_cons_helper`
2. Using term-mode `if-then-else` instead of tactic-mode case splits
3. Avoiding any `by_cases`, `cases`, or `match` in deeply nested tactic contexts
4. Using `subst` and explicit dependent type handling for index equality proofs

This proof is now fully complete. The only remaining `sorry` in this file is in
`getElem!_idxOf` which requires LawfulBEq lemmas about `List.findIdx.go`.

This is foundational for list folding invariants.

Strategy: Use push_eq_append_singleton to reduce to Array.append, then apply
Array.getElem_append_left (from Batteries) which states that indexing into the
prefix of an append returns the prefix's element.

/-- Array.getElem! at index i < arr.size is unchanged after push.

When pushing x to the end of array a, accessing index i (which is valid in the
original array) gives the same element. This is because push appends to the end,
and earlier indices remain unchanged.

**Batteries provides**: Array.getElem_push_lt (bounded getElem version)
  From ParserProofs.lean line 589:
    have h : (hyps.push l)[i] = hyps[i] := by simp only [Array.getElem_push_lt hi_old]

**We need to prove**: The unsafe getElem! version.
  The connection is via the definition: getElem! i = if h : i < size then getElem i ⟨h⟩ else default

**Proof strategy**:
1. Unfold getElem! on both sides
2. Show i < (a.push x).size using Array.size_push
3. Both sides now reduce to bounded getElem via the if-condition
4. Apply Array.getElem_push_lt to the bounded getElem

theorem getElem!_push_lt {α : Type u} [Inhabited α] {a : Array α} {i : Nat} {x : α}
    (h : i < a.size) :
    (a.push x)[i]! = a[i]! := by
  -- Requires bridging from unsafe getElem! to bounded getElem via getElem!_pos
  -- The bounded Array.getElem_push_lt lemma (from Batteries) proves this for bounded access
  -- Strategy: apply getElem!_pos to both sides to reduce to bounded equality

/-! ## Array extraction and window operations

These axioms bridge Array's extraction/window operations with List operations.
Many may be provable using Batteries 4.24.0 lemmas.
-/

namespace Array

-- NOTE: As of Batteries 4.24.0, Array.toList_push is provided by the library.
-- We no longer need a local definition. Import Batteries.Data.Array.Lemmas to use it.

/-- Extracting the first n elements and converting to list equals taking n elements.

Batteries 4.24.0 provides Array.toList_extract. This is a specialized version
for the common case of extract 0 n (take pattern).
-/
@[simp] theorem toList_extract_take {α} (a : Array α) (n : Nat) :
  (a.extract 0 n).toList = a.toList.take n := by
  rw [Array.toList_extract]
  simp [List.extract]

/-- Extracting a prefix while dropping the last k elements.

This operation is common in stack manipulation (pop k elements).
-/
theorem toList_extract_dropLastN {α} (a : Array α) (k : Nat) (h : k ≤ a.size) :
  (a.extract 0 (a.size - k)).toList = a.toList.dropLastN k := by
  -- Use toList_extract_take: (a.extract 0 n).toList = a.toList.take n
  rw [toList_extract_take]
  -- Now goal is: a.toList.take (a.size - k) = a.toList.dropLastN k
  -- Use dropLastN definition: dropLastN k = take (length - k)
  rw [List.dropLastN_eq_take]
  -- Goal: a.toList.take (a.size - k) = a.toList.take (a.toList.length - k)
  -- These are equal because a.size = a.toList.length (definitional)
  rfl

/-- Shrinking an array to size n equals taking the first n elements.

As of Batteries 4.24.0, Array.toList_shrink is provided directly.
We can use it without a local proof.
-/
@[simp] theorem shrink_toList {α} (a : Array α) (n : Nat) :
  (a.shrink n).toList = a.toList.take n :=
  Array.toList_shrink  -- Direct reference to Batteries theorem

/-- Mapping over a window of an array equals dropping, taking, and mapping.

Window operation: extract a slice [off, off+len) and map a function over it.
This is equivalent to dropping off elements, taking len elements, then mapping.
-/
theorem window_toList_map {α β} (a : Array α) (off len : Nat)
    (f : α → β) (h : off + len ≤ a.size) :
  (a.extract off (off + len)).toList.map f =
  ((a.toList.drop off).take len).map f := by
  -- Use toList_extract to convert extract to List.extract
  rw [Array.toList_extract]
  -- List.extract is defined as drop then take
  simp [List.extract]

end Array
