Bridge Module: Core Definitions and TypedSubst

This module provides the thin bridge layer between Spec and Kernel verification.
All definitions are simple and direct. Complex proofs remain in Kernel.lean.

**Design principle:** Bridge contains ONLY:
- Type definitions (TypedSubst)
- Helper functions (floats, essentials, needed)
- Simple extraction lemmas (~5 lines each)

**Status:** Phase 3 - Core infrastructure

/-! ## Core Type: TypedSubst

The central type that replaces the "phantom wff" toSubst function.
This structure bundles a substitution with a witness that it's well-typed.
-/

/-- A substitution that is **provably well-typed** with respect to a frame.

This structure bundles:
1. A spec-level substitution function σ : Variable → Expr
2. A witness that σ respects all floating hypothesis typecodes in the frame

**Key property:** No phantom values! If a floating hyp says "class x", then σ(x)
has typecode "class", guaranteed by the witness.

**Usage in Phase 3:**
- Replaces Option Subst with TypedSubst in toSubstTyped
- Eliminates the fallback behavior in toSubst
- Provides honest Option behavior (returns none on type errors)

**Construction:**
TypedSubst is constructed via checkHyp_produces_typed_coverage theorem,
which proves that checkHyp's output satisfies the typing witness.
-/
structure TypedSubst (fr : Spec.Frame) where
  /-- The underlying substitution function -/
  σ : Spec.Subst

  /-- Witness: substitution respects floating hypothesis typecodes

  For every floating hypothesis "c v" in the frame's mandatory hypotheses,
  the substitution σ(v) must have typecode c.

  This witness is the KEY difference from the old toSubst:
  - OLD: toSubst returned some (phantom wff fallback on error)
  - NEW: TypedSubst can only be constructed if checkHyp proves typing
  -/
  typed : ∀ {c : Spec.Constant} {v : Spec.Variable},
    Spec.Hyp.floating c v ∈ fr.mand →
    (σ v).typecode = c

/-! ## Helper Functions: Frame Structure Extraction

These functions extract components from frames for use in verification theorems.
All are simple filterMap operations with straightforward definitions.
-/

/-- Extract floating hypotheses from a frame.

Returns the list of all (typecode, variable) pairs from floating hypotheses.
Used to validate substitution coverage and construct TypedSubst witness.

**Definition:** filterMap over mandatory hypotheses, keeping only Hyp.floating cases.
-/
def floats (fr : Spec.Frame) : List (Spec.Constant × Spec.Variable) :=
  fr.mand.filterMap fun h =>
    match h with
    | Hyp.floating c v => some (c, v)
    | Hyp.essential _ => none

/-- Extract essential hypotheses from a frame.

Returns the list of all expressions from essential hypotheses.
These are the mandatory assumptions needed for an axiom/theorem application.

**Definition:** filterMap over mandatory hypotheses, keeping only Hyp.essential cases.
-/
def essentials (fr : Spec.Frame) : List Spec.Expr :=
  fr.mand.filterMap fun h =>
    match h with
    | Hyp.floating _ _ => none
    | Hyp.essential e => some e

/-- Compute what a substitution σ maps a hypothesis to.

For floating hyps "c v": apply σ to get σ(v)
For essential hyps "e": apply σ to all variables in e to get e[σ]

**Usage:** Building the "needed" list of instantiated hypotheses for ProofValid.useAxiom.
-/
def needOf (vars : List Spec.Variable) (σ : Spec.Subst) (h : Spec.Hyp) : Spec.Expr :=
  match h with
  | Hyp.floating c v => σ v
  | Hyp.essential e => applySubst vars σ e

/-- Compute the list of needed hypothesis instantiations.

Given a frame and substitution, compute what each mandatory hypothesis becomes
after applying the substitution.

This is the "needed" list that stepAssert expects to find on the stack.

**Definition:** Map needOf over all mandatory hypotheses.

**Property:** needed list has same length as fr.mand (by List.map).
-/
def needed (vars : List Spec.Variable) (fr : Spec.Frame) (σ : Spec.Subst) : List Spec.Expr :=
  fr.mand.map (needOf vars σ)

/-! ## Helper Lemmas: Frame Structure Preservation

These lemmas show that floats/essentials faithfully represent frame structure.
All proofs are straightforward by filterMap definition.
